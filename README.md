###Usage

The extension detects (most) music or video files that you are currently playing or viewing on a website and places a download link (the resembles the logo) on the right side of the omnibox (between the urls and the star icon). Just click that to start the download. 

###Installation

1. Download the latest version from [here](https://github.com/imagentleman/Web-Noire/releases/download/26/web-noire.zip).

2. Extract the folder from the zip and place it in a permanent location on your hard drive (anywhere you'd like).
3. Open Chrome and navigte to [chrome://extensions/](chrome://extensions/) or click on `Settings (icon with 3 horizontal lines) -> Tools -> Extensions.`.
4. Tick the `Developer Mode` checkbox to enable the manual installation of extension (from outside the webstore).
5. Then click `Load Unpacked Extension...` and select the folder `Web Noire` (from step 1).

###Note

The extension had to be taken down from the Chrome Webstore, because due to its nature, it infringed one section of its policies. Specifically this rule: 

_We don't allow products or services that encourage, facilitate, or enable the unauthorized access, download, or streaming of copyrighted content or media_
