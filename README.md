Chrome Extension to download music and videos from websites

###Usage

The extension detects (most) music or video files that you are currently playing or viewing on a website and places a download link (the resembles the logo) on the right side of the omnibox (between the urls and the star icon). Just click that to start the download. 

It doesn't work on every site. 

Sometimes for copyright reason some videos can't be downloaded.

Sometimes it doesn't work on embedded videos (on a blog post, etc), but it does on the original site (the one hosting the video. 

###Installation

1. Download the latest version from [here](https://github.com/imagentleman/Web-Noire/releases/download/latest/web-noire.zip).

2. Extract the folder from the zip and place it in a permanent location on your hard drive (anywhere you'd like).
3. Open Chrome and navigte to [chrome://extensions/](chrome://extensions/) or click on `Settings (icon with 3 horizontal lines) -> Tools -> Extensions.`.
4. Tick the `Developer Mode` checkbox to enable the manual installation of extension (from outside the webstore).
5. Then click `Load Unpacked Extension...` and select the folder `Web Noire` (from step 1).

###Notes

The extension had to be taken down from the Chrome Webstore, because due to its nature, it infringed one section of the store policies. Specifically this rule: 

_We don't allow products or services that encourage, facilitate, or enable the unauthorized access, download, or streaming of copyrighted content or media_
